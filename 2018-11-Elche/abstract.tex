P2PSP is a protocol for multimedia content (usually video)
streaming. It is quite simple and tries to emulate the functionality
of IP multicast (basically, where all group members can communicate
with each other through a multicast IP address). For this task, P2PSP
uses the P2P (peer-to-peer) paradigm which allows to design highly
scalable streaming systems.
